Optimization Techniques:
    1- Indexing 
        (select users from specific city that watched a specific team in the team's home match).
    2- Partitioning by range 
        (select users that attended matches in range of date).
    3- Partitioning by hash
        (select users that attended any match and sit on the first row i.e. y = 1).
    4- Multiple Indexing 
        (select users that attended any match and sit far i.e. x = 20 and y = 50).
    5- Query Optimization
        (we will optimize some/all above queries).
    6- Memory buffer (cashing).

    for all selection statements select fname and lname of the users.
