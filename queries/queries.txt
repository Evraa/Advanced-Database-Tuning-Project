Optimization Techniques:
    1- Indexing 
        (select users from specific city that watched a specific team in the team's home match).
    2- Multiple Indexing 
        (select users that attended any match and sit at i.e. x = 10 and y = 12).
    3- Range Indexing
        (select users that attended any match and sit far i.e. x > 12 and y > 12).
    4- Indexing OR vs UNION
        (select users (with specific fname or from specific city) that watched a specific team in the team's home match).
    5- Memory buffer (cashing).
        (same as fourth query)
    6- Schema Optimization.
        (select users that sit on a seat where y = 10).

    for all selection statements select fname and lname of the users.
